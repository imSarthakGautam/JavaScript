//.slice(beg,end) function

/*
The slice method returns a copy of certain elements of an array. 
It can take two arguments, 
- the first gives the index of where to begin the slice,
- the second is the index for where to end the slice (and it's non-inclusive). 

If the arguments are not provided, the default is to start at the beginning of the array through the end, which is an easy way to make a copy of the entire array. The slice method does not mutate the original array, but returns a new one. */

function sliceArray(anim, beginSlice, endSlice) {
    return anim.slice(beginSlice,endSlice)
    }
    
    const inputAnim = ["Cat", "Dog", "Tiger", "Zebra", "Ant"];
    sliceArray(inputAnim, 1, 3);
